Resume Job Description Matching Rules

Skill matching is based on comparing the skills extracted from the resume with the skills required in the job description.

The match percentage is calculated using the formula:
(Number of matched skills ÷ Number of required skills) × 100

Only skills that appear in both the resume and the job description are counted as matched skills.

If a required skill from the job description does not appear in the resume, it is counted as a missing skill.

The match percentage is rounded to the nearest whole number for clear presentation to the user.

Match strength is categorized as follows:

70% and above: Strong match

40% to 69%: Moderate match

Below 40%: Weak match

This matching logic helps users quickly understand how well their resume fits a specific job role and what skills they need to improve.
