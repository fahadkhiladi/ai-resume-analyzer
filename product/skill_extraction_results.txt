Skills correctly detected:

None (only real skills from the predefined list are detected)

Skills missed:

Unreal or vague skills (correct behavior)

Wrongly detected skills:

None

Observation:
The system correctly ignores fake or non-technical skills that are not in the skill list.

Overall Conclusion

The skill extraction works well for clearly written technical skills.

Skills written indirectly or using different wording may be missed.

The system does not falsely detect skills that are not in the predefined list.

Accuracy can be improved in the future using advanced NLP techniques and synonym matching.
